4/22/95 - v0.99a - Released

4/23/95 - Initialized the arrays used internally by the menu differently.
4/23/95 - Changed place where menu calculates the longest menu command.
          This now gets updated whenever a menu command function or menu
          command submenu gets added instead of the a submenu is loaded.
4/23/95 - Added completely memory allocation testing.  This had been
          overlooked in the DOS port.
4/24/95 - Changed the way memory pointers are deinitialized to help stop
          lockups when win_deinit gets called and it tries to free any
          memory that might not have been freed yet.
4/25/95 - Changed the code and used actual functions instead of defines to
          accomplish the window updating.  This has solved may odd bugs that
          showed up in the earlier versions.
4/25/95 - Added a timed pause in the demo so that you can sit back and watch
          instead of having to hit the key to make it continue the whole time.

4/26/95 - v0.99b - Released

4/27/95 - Fixed a major bug that was corrupting the heap in one of the
          display functions.  This was the cause of many unknown and
          untrackable errors that were occuring.
4/28/95 - Improved resize function to make it faster and use less memory.
4/29/95 - Added text mode changing to the demo.
4/29/95 - Added implode and explode functions.
4/29/95 - Added WIN_EXPLODE and WIN_IMPLODE to create attribute to cause
          the windows to either explode on creation, implode on destroy, or
          both.
4/29/95 - Formatted documentation with a left margin so that holes can be
          punched in it to bind etc. without conflicting with the text.

4/29/95 - v0.99c - Released

4/30/95 - Fixed visibility calculation bug.  If two windows overlapped, but
          none of the corners of either box fill inside the other box than
          it would think that the window was completely visible.
4/30/95 - Added mouse sub-system and support for mouse in menus and forms
          under DOS and OS/2.
5/07/95 - Added ato? functions for the unsigned data types.  This corrects
          input problems with large unsigned numbers.
5/09/95 - Added OS/2, DOS under OS/2, DV, Windows, and Windows/386 time slice
          support.
5/12/95 - Finished new data entry system.  This new system is a thousand times
          easier to use and provides 20 data types and user definable keys.
5/12/95 - Added clr_eoc function
5/12/95 - Added fill_col function
5/12/95 - Added fill_row function

5/17/95 - v0.99d - Released

5/19/95 - Fixed bug in menu_c::add_menucmd_submenu function.
5/20/95 - Fixed bug in menu_c::destroy that would crash program when it tried
          to destroy windows that corresponded with the submenus.
5/20/95 - Switched some pointers instead of copying structures.  This should
          provide a slight speed increase and less CPU usage while menu loaded.
5/20/95 - Improved a OS/2 mouse support in forms.  Buttons now unclick
          correctly.
5/21/95 - Added form_set_default_colors and form_c::default_colors to eliminate
          the repetitive calling of the same colors in a program
6/01/95 - Too many changes to note.  Revised many things including mouse
          handler, windows, menu.
6/02/95 - Added listboxes to form.
6/08/95 - Added seamless multithreaded window functions.
6/09/95 - Added automatic including of stdio.h and conio.h headers when ti2.h
          is included to solve any problems if the programmer forgets to
          include these before they include ti2.h

6/10/95 - v0.99e - Released

6/13/95 - Improved win_c::create parameter checking.  If a parameter contains
          an incorrect value it will display an error message and display
          the parameter and the maximum or minimum value that the parameter
          could have been.
